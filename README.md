# Solving Sudoku Puzzle With AI
This project is able to solve easy-to-medium level Sudoku puzzles where there is no need to choose between two or more possibilities in each puzzle grid.

## How to play
Sudoku is played on a 9*9 grid and it is also separated into 9 boxes (each box has a 3*3 grid). The initial configuration of Sudoku is a partially filled board. We need to figure out how to put the digits 1-9 on the grid so that each digit appears exactly once in each row, column, and box.

## Using AI
I used a CNN model to recognize the handful numbers which are initially filled some grids.
